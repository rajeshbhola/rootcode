Welcome to **RootCode** - your new Jekyll-powered blog! This is your first blog post, and we're excited to have you here.

## What is RootCode?

RootCode is a clean, minimal Jekyll blog built with the Reverie theme. It's designed to help you focus on what matters most: your content.

## Features

This blog comes with several great features out of the box:

- **Clean Design**: A minimalist, distraction-free reading experience
- **Responsive Layout**: Looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Perfect for sharing code snippets
- **SEO Optimized**: Built-in SEO tags and sitemap generation
- **RSS Feed**: Let readers subscribe to your content
- **Social Links**: Easy integration with social media profiles

## Getting Started

To create a new post, simply add a new markdown file to the `_posts` directory with the following naming convention:

```
YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.md
```

For example: `2025-01-15-my-first-post.md`

### Front Matter

Each post should start with YAML front matter:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title: Your Post Title
categories: [Category1, Category2]
---
```

## Code Highlighting

You can easily share code snippets with syntax highlighting. Here's an example in Python:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello from RootCode!")
    return True

if __name__ == "__main__":
    hello_world()
```

And here's some JavaScript:

```javascript
const greet = (name) => {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}! Welcome to RootCode.`);
};

greet('Developer');
```
